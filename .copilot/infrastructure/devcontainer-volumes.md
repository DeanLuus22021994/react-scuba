# Volume Strategy and Management

## Hybrid Volume Architecture

The development environment implements a hybrid volume strategy combining named volumes for dependency isolation with bind mounts for hot reload capabilities.

### Strategic Principles

**Named Volumes**: Complete isolation of node_modules and package caches
**Bind Mounts**: Source code access for real-time development feedback
**Container-Local Storage**: Ephemeral build artifacts cleaned per lifecycle

## Workspace-Specific Named Volumes

Each npm workspace receives dedicated named volume for complete dependency isolation. This prevents cross-contamination and enables independent version management.

### Volume Naming Pattern

All volumes follow convention: `react_scuba_{workspace}_node_modules`

### Workspace Volume Assignments

**Root Workspace**: `react_scuba_root_node_modules`
**Frontend Application**: `react_scuba_web_node_modules`
**Backend API**: `react_scuba_api_node_modules`
**Content Provider**: `react_scuba_content_node_modules`
**Documentation**: `react_scuba_docs_node_modules`
**Shared Configuration**: `react_scuba_config_node_modules`
**Type Definitions**: `react_scuba_types_node_modules`
**UI Components**: `react_scuba_ui_node_modules`
**Utilities**: `react_scuba_utils_node_modules`

### Isolation Benefits

**Zero Pollution**: No node_modules directories in source tree
**Clean Git Operations**: Faster operations without ignored directories
**Independent Management**: Each workspace manages versions separately
**Build Performance**: Native npm workspace caching for clean builds

## Bind Mount Strategy

### Source Code Mounting

**Primary Mount**: `./server:/workspace` with read-write access
**Purpose**: Enable hot module replacement and instant code reflection
**Scope**: All application source code and configuration files

### Python Utilities Mounting

**Secondary Mount**: `./docker-compose-examples/mcp/python_utils:/app`
**Access Mode**: Read-only for service, writable from host
**Purpose**: Enable Python MCP service development with hot reload

### Development Feedback Loop

Bind mounts enable sub-100ms development feedback:
- File system changes immediately visible to container
- Hot module replacement triggers automatic rebuilds
- No manual synchronization required
- Native file system performance

## Container-Local Storage

### Build Artifact Strategy

Build outputs stored in container-local directories:
- Automatically cleaned on container recreation
- No volume persistence overhead
- Fresh builds guaranteed on infrastructure updates

### Temporary File Management

Temporary files and caches use container filesystem:
- No cleanup required (automatic on container removal)
- Isolated from persistent state
- Optimal for ephemeral data

## Volume Lifecycle Management

### Creation Patterns

Volumes automatically created on first container startup. No manual initialization required.

### Persistence Guarantees

Named volumes survive:
- Container recreation
- Container updates
- Development environment rebuilds
- Docker Compose down operations (without -v flag)

### Cleanup Strategies

**Selective Cleanup**: Remove specific workspace volumes for fresh start
**Full Cleanup**: Docker Compose down with -v flag removes all volumes
**Volume Inspection**: Examine volume contents for debugging

## Performance Characteristics

### Build Performance

**Named Volume Benefits**:
- Instant container startup (dependencies pre-installed)
- Native npm workspace caching for clean builds
- Parallel workspace builds without interference

**Bind Mount Benefits**:
- Zero-latency code changes
- Immediate test feedback
- Hot module replacement support

### Storage Optimization

**Volume Deduplication**: Docker handles block-level deduplication
**Cache Efficiency**: Package manager caches shared across rebuilds
**Minimal Host Storage**: Only source code stored on host

## Permission Management

### Volume Ownership

Volumes owned by container user (typically `vscode` or `node`)

### Permission Patterns

**Named Volumes**: Container user has full read-write access
**Bind Mounts**: Permissions inherited from host filesystem
**Permission Conflicts**: Resolved via container user mapping

## Integration with MCP Services

### MCP Persistent Volumes

Python MCP service uses dedicated volumes:
- `react_scuba_python_mcp_packages` for Python packages
- `react_scuba_python_mcp_state` for service state
- `react_scuba_python_mcp_cache` for Python cache
- `react_scuba_python_mcp_uv_cache` for UV package manager

### Service State Persistence

MCP service state survives main container rebuilds, ensuring service continuity during development workflow disruptions.

## Troubleshooting Volume Issues

### Permission Errors

**Symptom**: Cannot write to mounted directories
**Resolution**: Verify container user matches volume ownership
**Fix Command**: Change ownership to container user

### Stale Dependency Issues

**Symptom**: Old package versions persisting
**Resolution**: Remove and recreate workspace-specific volume
**Prevention**: Use volume versioning for breaking changes

### Volume Corruption

**Symptom**: Inconsistent behavior or build failures
**Resolution**: Remove and recreate affected volumes
**Recovery**: Fresh npm install rebuilds dependencies

### Disk Space Management

**Monitoring**: Check Docker volume usage regularly
**Cleanup**: Remove unused volumes via Docker prune
**Optimization**: Consider volume size limits for large workspaces

## Development Workflow Integration

### Fresh Start Procedure

Remove specific workspace volume for clean slate while preserving other workspaces.

### Dependency Update Workflow

Update package.json, remove workspace volume, restart container for clean install.

### Multi-Workspace Development

Named volumes enable simultaneous development across multiple workspaces without dependency conflicts.

## Future Considerations

### Volume Versioning

Consider volume naming with version suffixes for major dependency updates.

### Remote Volume Storage

Evaluate network-attached storage for volume backing in distributed development environments.

### Volume Snapshots

Implement volume snapshot capabilities for rapid environment replication.
