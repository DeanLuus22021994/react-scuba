# Multi-Industry Architecture Patterns

## Purpose

AI-optimized reference for understanding how the platform extends beyond diving centers to support multiple business verticals.

## Evolution from Single-Industry to Multi-Industry

### Phase 1: Diving-Specific Architecture

Original design assumptions:

- All clients are diving centers
- Courses and dive sites always present
- Team members always have diving certifications
- Industry-specific terminology hardcoded

Limitations:

- Cannot onboard non-diving businesses
- Configuration schema too rigid
- UI components assume diving context
- Navigation structure diving-centric

### Phase 2: Industry-Agnostic Architecture

Redesigned for flexibility:

- Industry-specific fields marked optional
- Generic content types (services, products, case studies)
- Flexible team member structure
- Configurable terminology and labels
- UI components adapt to available content

## Flexible Content Types

### Universal Content Types

Available to all industries:

**Services**: Professional services offered (consulting, training, development)
**Products**: Physical or digital products (software, equipment, merchandise)
**Team Members**: Staff profiles with flexible certification structure
**Case Studies**: Portfolio items, project showcases, client success stories
**Gallery**: Image collections adaptable to any industry

### Industry-Specific Content Types

Optional based on business vertical:

**Courses**: Training and certification programs (diving, professional development)
**Dive Sites**: Geographic locations (diving-specific)
**Properties**: Real estate listings (real estate industry)
**Menu Items**: Food and beverage offerings (hospitality industry)

### Content Type Selection

Clients choose relevant content types:

- Configuration includes only needed content types
- UI components conditionally render based on available content
- Navigation automatically adjusts to present content
- Empty content types hidden from user interface

## Supported Business Verticals

### Currently Implemented

**Diving Centers**: Full course and dive site management
**Software Development Companies**: Product showcase and case study portfolios
**Digital Agencies**: Service offerings and client project galleries

### Planned Verticals

**Professional Services**: Consulting firms, legal practices, accounting firms
**Healthcare Providers**: Clinics, wellness centers, therapy practices
**Education Institutions**: Schools, training centers, tutoring services
**Hospitality**: Hotels, restaurants, event venues
**Retail**: Online stores, boutiques, specialty shops
**Real Estate**: Property listings, agent profiles, market analysis

## Schema Flexibility Patterns

### Optional Field Strategy

Implementation approach:

- All industry-specific fields marked with optional flag
- Validation allows missing industry fields
- Default values prevent undefined errors
- UI components check field existence before rendering

### Type Union Patterns

Flexible typing:

- Team member certifications accept diving OR professional certifications
- Content items union of multiple content types
- Navigation items adapt to available pages
- Feature flags control industry-specific features

### Configuration Inheritance

Template-based extension:

- Base template provides universal fields
- Industry templates extend base with specific fields
- Clients inherit from industry template
- Custom fields added without breaking validation

## Onboarding Patterns by Industry

### Diving Centers

Configuration includes:

- Courses array with PADI/SSI certifications
- Dive sites with GPS coordinates and difficulty ratings
- Team with diving instructor certifications
- Equipment rental products
- Diving services (guided dives, equipment service)

### Software Companies

Configuration includes:

- Products array with software offerings
- Case studies showcasing client projects
- Team with technical certifications (AWS, Microsoft, etc.)
- Services (consulting, development, support)
- No courses or dive sites

### Professional Services

Configuration includes:

- Services array with consultation offerings
- Team with professional credentials (CPA, JD, PE)
- Case studies with client success stories
- No products, courses, or dive sites
- Focus on expertise and experience

## UI Adaptation Strategies

### Conditional Rendering

Components adapt based on content:

- Navigation menu items generated from available content
- Homepage sections shown only if content exists
- Feature pages hidden if feature flag disabled
- Generic labels replace industry-specific terminology

### Terminology Customization

Flexible language:

- "Services" instead of hardcoded "Diving Services"
- "Portfolio" instead of "Dive Sites" for non-diving
- "Team" instead of "Instructors" for generic context
- Configurable labels in theme configuration

### Layout Flexibility

Responsive to content types:

- Homepage hero adapts to primary content type
- Service grids work for both diving and professional services
- Gallery supports multiple content contexts
- Team profiles show relevant certification badges

## Scalability Considerations

### Adding New Industries

Process for supporting new verticals:

1. Identify industry-specific content needs
2. Create optional content type definitions
3. Add industry template to clients directory
4. Update UI components for new content rendering
5. Document industry-specific onboarding process

### Backwards Compatibility

Ensuring existing clients unaffected:

- New optional fields don't impact existing configs
- Default values prevent undefined errors
- Legacy content types continue working
- Migration scripts for breaking changes optional

### Performance Impact

Multi-industry architecture efficiency:

- Optional fields minimal memory overhead
- Validation performance unaffected by unused fields
- UI rendering only processes present content
- Caching works identically across industries

## Best Practices for Multi-Industry Support

### Configuration Design

Recommendations:

- Keep industry-specific fields clearly separated
- Document which fields apply to which industries
- Provide industry-specific templates
- Use descriptive field names avoiding jargon
- Group related fields logically

### Content Modeling

Flexible content structure:

- Use generic content types where possible
- Make industry fields optional by default
- Provide rich metadata for content types
- Support custom fields per industry
- Enable content type extensibility

### UI Component Design

Adaptable components:

- Check content existence before rendering
- Use generic labels with configuration overrides
- Support multiple content contexts
- Implement fallback content gracefully
- Test with content present and absent

## Industry-Specific Customization

### Theme Variations

Visual adaptation:

- Color schemes appropriate to industry
- Typography matching industry expectations
- Imagery relevant to business vertical
- Layout patterns common to industry

### Feature Flags

Industry-appropriate functionality:

- E-commerce for product-based businesses
- Booking systems for appointment-based services
- Course enrollment for education providers
- Property search for real estate
- Menu ordering for hospitality

### SEO Optimization

Industry-specific search optimization:

- Keywords tailored to industry terminology
- Meta descriptions matching industry language
- Structured data for industry entities
- Local SEO for location-based businesses
