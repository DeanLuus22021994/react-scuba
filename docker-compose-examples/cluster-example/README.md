# [CLUSTER-EXAMPLE-001](#cluster-example-001) Cluster Example

<a id="fr-cluster-example-001-functional-requirements"></a>

## [FR-CLUSTER-EXAMPLE-001](#fr-cluster-example-001-functional-requirements) Functional Requirements

- Load-balanced cluster configuration
- Multiple nginx web servers
- Devcontainer as load balancer
- Service health checks
- Named volumes and networking

### FR Validation Criteria

- Docker Compose file defines load balancer and multiple app instances
- Nginx configured as reverse proxy with upstream servers
- Devcontainer includes load balancing configuration
- Health check endpoints defined for all services
- Named volumes configured for data persistence

## [UAC-CLUSTER-EXAMPLE-001](#uac-cluster-example-001-user-acceptance-criteria) User Acceptance Criteria

- All services start successfully
- Load balancer distributes traffic
- Health checks pass for all services
- Applications accessible via HTTP
- Cleanup removes all containers and volumes

### UAC Validation Criteria

- All containers running via `docker-compose ps`
- Load balancer verified with multiple requests showing different servers
- Health check URLs return success status codes
- HTTP traffic flows through load balancer to applications
- Cleanup confirmed with `docker volume ls` showing no volumes

## [BLK-CLUSTER-EXAMPLE-001](#blk-cluster-example-001-blockers) Blockers

- Port conflicts on host
- Build failures in containers
- Network connectivity issues
- Resource limitations

### BLK Validation Criteria

- Host port 80 available for load balancer
- Container images build successfully without errors
- Docker network allows inter-container communication
- System resources sufficient for multiple containers
